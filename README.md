## Description
The purpose of this project was to create a study guide that would be helpful during our learning experience for the full stack developer bootcamp.

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser.
